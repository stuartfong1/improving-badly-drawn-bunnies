# 🐇 Improving Badly Drawn Bunnies
### QM-6 Innovation, Computer Vision Node

This AI project aims to enhance poorly drawn sketches by employing generative models for vectorized sketch generation, specifically by conditioning sketches to better represent their intended class. Utilizing the Quick, Draw! dataset, the solution builds on the sketch-rnn model and other state-of-the-art methods, with a dedicated web application for user interaction.
